# The following settings configure Adguard to run as a part of tailnet. This
# allows to configure adguard for a tailnet DNS server under
# https://tailscale.com/admin/dns -> Nameservers
#
# IMPORTANT 1: See IMPORTANTs in tailscale service description
#
# NOTE 1: Local network is not accessible within tailnet, which means that if i
# create an adguard DNS rewrite for 'my-site.local' to '192.168.0.20', the site
# will not be reachable in the tailnet. SOLUTION: deploy another tailscale
# service with "advertised routes" (https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets)
