# Tailscale makes creating software-defined networks easy: securely connecting
# users, services, and devices.
#   https://tailscale.com/
# -----
# Versions:
# * https://hub.docker.com/r/tailscale/tailscale/tags
# -----
# Meant for tailscale server configuration: https://tailscale.com/kb/1352/servers
#
# IMPORTANT 1: Auth key is required for initial container run:
# https://tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys -> 'Generate auth key...'
#   -> generate single time or reusable
#
# IMPORTANT 2: After deployment https://tailscale.com/admin/machines -> 3 dots
# next to the machine -> Disable key expiry (to avoid re-login to tailscale)
#
# IMPORTANT 3: With changed routes or exit node params service requires a valid
# auth key, i.e. if it's one-timer new one must be provided
#
# NOTE 1: The service is useless unless it's configured for exit node or subnet
# router. Both need to be confirmed in the machines admin
